# free-corTeX
## A free continuous integration framework for open scientific communication based-on LaTeX
Nearly a decade ago, December 2011, [Roger Peng](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1213847) published an spectrum of reproducibility which depicts a roadmap of a scientific outcome that went from publication only to full replication (e.g., including code, data and software).
Such spectrum was a cornerstone for the publication of the [first open-accessible](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3384145) and 100\% reproducible engineering-based PhD thesis in August 2019 at the University of Birmingham established in 1900.
Even thought of such achievement, there are few challenges in the existing system of formal scientific communication.
Such challenges were recently described by [Heise and Pearce 2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244020915900) for aspects of evaluation of scientific work, speed in the communication process, respect for the freedom of science and research, dissemination and accessibility, digitization, verifiability of scientific knowledge, quality, and prevention of misuse and scientific misconduct.
Alongside with the state-of-the-art of research software engineering in the context of open access science that is starting to make use of continuous integration tools [(Luger and Foreman-Mackey 2019)](https://github.com/rodluger/corTeX) and containers [(Xu 2020)](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action).
That being said, this work introduce a proof-of-concept "free-corTeX: A free continuous integration framework for open scientific communication based-on LaTeX" as an updated version of the spectrum of reproducibility for formal scientific communication.
Using free-corTeX, one can create various academic documents such as thesis, cv, slides, and reports. 
The adoption of free-corTeX might lead to scientific outcomes that are well aligned to the principles of reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, reusability and open accessibility.
